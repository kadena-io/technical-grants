## PURPOSE

On April 21st 2022, Kadena Eco has launched a $100 million Grant Program to inspire builders to come and innovate on the Kadena network.

Kadena Eco exists to empower builders to create new projects that transform the world. To realize this mission, we’re doubling down on our growing community by deploying our treasury resources towards the long-term sustainability of our ecosystem. 

Kadena Eco grants will be applied to projects big and small, enabling builders of all backgrounds to succeed on Kadena. With our network of technology experts and strategic partners, we’re here to support builders every step of the way.  

## HOW IT WORKS

The application process is [open](https://khnrs3ltkjv.typeform.com/grant-app?typeform-source=www.google.com)!  All high-quality, open-source projects for gaming, metaverse, NFT, Web3, DeFi and DAO are welcome.   

We will judge grant applications based on the following: 

1. Technical strength
2. Detail of specifications
3. Team experience
4. Practicality

Applicants must be willing to adopt Kadena’s “build in the open” philosophy by contributing content, tutorials and product explainers in relevant channels and communities such as Discord, Medium, Stackoverflow and others. In turn, Kadena Eco will commit to engineering mentorship, office hours and community leadership in addition to monetary support. 

Beyond grant money, you’ll also get support from the Kadena team to get you off the ground and building for success.
