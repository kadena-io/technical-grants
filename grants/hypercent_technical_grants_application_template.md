## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### 1.1 Title

![hypercent_banner2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63142809/140494926-0142242f-2a7f-432e-a21a-64d280fe9943.png)


### **Hypercent - Where Verified Projects Launch On The True Home of DeFi**

We are building a Launchpad that aims to incubate and bring outside projects to Kadena and funnel them back into the Kadenian community through our $HPRC token.


### 1.2 Motivation

We've been active in the crypto space since late 2016, so we have a fair share of experience in judging a project's potential. In January 2021 a friend told us to look into Kadena.  After extensive research we thought that things where too good to be true. We couldn't understand how the only scalable POW blockchain had a market cap below $100 mil.

Thinking that the reason for that was the lack of projects building on Kadena, we decided to use our marketing experience to help Kadena attract more projects willing to build on its blockchain.  We've made a series of suggestions on the branding and website side to make Kadena more appealing to the crypto community and reached out to the team to present them.

Meeting the Kadena team was amazing, we found a group of passionate people with a build first, marketing second approach, unwilling to rush anything unfinished to gain market position. Kadena has its rhythm and nobody's gonna change that.

Our proposals were met with enthusiasm but everyone decided they were too radical for a big operation like Kadena. We decided the best way to bring projects to Kadena is to build a launchpad when conditions are favorable.

Hypercent helps verified projects launch on Kadena, the true home of DeFi. Our job as Kadenians is to help good projects launch on Kadena while protecting fellow Kadenians from shady projects.


### 1.3 Why build on Kadena?

As marketers, business owners and blockchain entrepreneur's ourselves, we have a very good understanding of how different factors need to intersect ensure success. This gives us a good understanding of how the future of blockchain will look like.

Kadena is THE platform in which all the essential pieces to achieve that fall into place, thus actually having the potential to become the future of mainstream blockchain.


**A. The future of blockchain has much better user experience that is ready for mass adoption.**

With Kadena's gas station and low gas fees, app developers can enter a new realm of providing a user experience that is seamless.


**B. Blockchain without security is worthless.**

POW underwent massive trials and errors, and on the back of that people have the confidence to invest money into BTC today. Kadena is that and more, so as true blockchain believers no other blockchain today can meet our criteria.


***C. We love what we do***

We have deep roots into this community and we have experience in succeeding. Hypercent is the medium in which we can bring new developers to pact, lobby new projects to consider Kadena and engange into many community related activities, thus continuing to share our love for this great project.


***D. Timing is perfect***

As early kadenians we understand this project better than most people do. We knew that before we can create Hypercent and start to lobby projects to come build on Kadena we first required two conditions to be met:

- A higher price for Kadena so people could reinvest profit back into the ecosystem.
- A browser extension wallet and a DEX so the experience would be seamless.

As these conditions will soon be met in the very near future, it is time for us to do our part to.

## 4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1. **Market fit:** What problem / need does your project address and how is it different from existing solutions?

A LaunchPad is needed for an ecosystem of projects to start developing on Kadena. Even more than that, a LaunchPad is not just a tech tool but also a marketing tool. A launchpad that just works vs a launchpad that works and has a proved marketing and connected team behind it is what we believe that the Kadena ecosystem needs right now.

With our blockchain connections and marketing experience that generated multi million dollars in revenue both for our previous projects as well as other ventures we are the perfect match to take the Kadena ecosystem to new heights.

2. **Current progress:** Has any work been done so far? Does this project build on / rely on any existing software? Please share any relevant links and mockups.

The website has already been launched, an extensive team of advisors has already been secured, projects have already been contacted to build on Kadena.

3. **Engagement:** How do you plan to roll out the completed project for community awareness and engagement?

Community has already been engaged and Hypercent has been already voted the most anticipated project after Kaddex. With imense support from the community we have been humbled in noticing that without announcing or posting an official release of our project, we have been discovered, shared and received tremendous support from the community in builiding our project.

We have been retweeted by crypto influencers purely on organic media reach and our twitter has raised over 1300 followers in 1 week and generated 60.000 organical impressions.

I will upload a couple of attachments in support of that.

4. **Future plans:** Once the project is completed, do you plan to maintain or build upon it in the future?

Once the project is completed, that is when we will start and do our job in growing the ecosystem. Hypercent is a full time commitment for us as Co-Founders of the project and as passionate kadenians, that started long before this opporunity presented itself.

We love the Kadena ecosystem and we don't see that changing anytime soon.


5. **Other:** Please share any other relevant information.

Looking foreward to kickstarting the grant process, and if anything needs to be negotiated further and that is open for discussion, please let us know. Any support we receive from Kadena is much appreciated.

Thank you!
