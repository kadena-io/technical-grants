## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Kadena Statistics will be analysing the blockchain and providing the data in easy to digest dashboards and tables.  
I want to provide a transparent and easy way to examine the blockchain and the content deployed on it.  
It will affect a lot of users of the network to have access to clear information about what's hapenning on the network.  
I chose to build on Kadena because it is the future.  



## 2. TEAM BACKGROUND

I, Thanos, am currently the sole member of the team.  
I do not have a developper background, I manage mining farms.  
Here is some images of my previous work, those were my first GUI.

GUI Miner EPIC was used to simplify the usage of a GRIN fork. It consist of a combination of 3 different  
programs needed to utilize the coin in a GUI.  
Doge Digger managed and autoupdated many miners, also kept preset to change coins quick.

## 4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1. **Market fit:** What problem / need does your project address and how is it different from existing solutions?  
The dashboard addresses the difficulty of vizualisating the blockchain. It differs by being easy to read and understand.

2. **Current progress:** Has any work been done so far? Does this project build on / rely on any existing software? Please share any relevant links and mockups.  
Yes, there is a beta live at https://anedak.com/beta (formerly kdastats.sick.network). It relies on Metabase to produce the charts

3. **Engagement:** How do you plan to roll out the completed project for community awareness and engagement?  
The beta is already rolled out and the community is enjoying it. Awareness is mouth to ear.

4. **Future plans:** Once the project is completed, do you plan to maintain or build upon it in the future?  
Yes, this will be maintained and updates will be as frequent as possible.

5. **Other:** Please share any other relevant information.  
Everyone in the community seems to like it and I think it would be great to turn this from a sketch half running from my home pc to a real website.
