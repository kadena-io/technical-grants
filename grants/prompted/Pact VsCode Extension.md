1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is to add syntax highlighting for the Pact programming language in Visual Studio Code, as mentioned in the 'prompted' categories.


2. TEAM BACKGROUND

The team exists of 1 member, me, Floor de Best.

I’m working as a contractor / self-employed mechanical engineer and about 20 years ago I started in webdesign as a hobby. Over the years I had many (product) ideas and built them besides my job. I’m an autodidact and over the years learned skills like hardware design (including schematics, pcb design and pcb assembly), product design (3d drawing, 3d printing, machining) and software development: webApps (php/html/css), native mobile (Swift, Kotlin, Flutter and now React Native), chip specific software (Python, C).

Although I learned a lot over the years, I never learned the ins and outs on each language and that is where I want to focus on now, really learn a language and use it to its full potential.

Many software projects I did are discarded without any final product, or no longer active.

4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
1.        Market fit: What problem / need does your project address and how is it different from existing solutions?

There is no current support for syntax highlighting in pact/repl files. The extension supports that.


2.        Current progress: Has any work been done so far? Does this project build on / rely on any existing software? Please share any relevant links and mockups.

The extension is finished and launched on the VSCode. Marketplace

3.        Engagement: How do you plan to roll out the completed project for community awareness and engagement?

I mentioned it in the ‘builders’ telegram group.


4.        Future plans: Once the project is completed, do you plan to maintain or build upon it in the future?

Maintenance will continue as this project represents my personal work and is part of my portfolio and I would like to maintain a high standard. People can contact me for additional functionalities.
