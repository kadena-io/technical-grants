## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Name: dEDI (Decentralized Electronic Data Interchange)

Description: A Web 3.0 on-ramp for traditional EDI providers and users. A robust, decentralized platform with the capabilities of handling all EDI transactions (approx. 20 billions transactions annually.) 

Objective: secure a large percentage of the $26b a year market of EDI with a decentralized platform.

Why Kadena: We are currently set to be part of the Solana Ecosystem, but with 480,000 transactions per second and the ability to pay for other user's transactions it seems to us that Kadena would be a better fit for our project. The scalability of your network is beyong anything else we've seen, and given the size of the market we are entering we will need all the scalability we can find.

## 4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1. **Market fit:** There are currently 3 major barriers to entry for legacy EDI. Those are Cost, difficulty to implement, and time requirements to implment. We are THE ONLY EDI like solution that is planning on democratizing EDI functionalities and the only one's, as far as we know, that plan on becoming a dAPP. We will democratize EDI functionalities so that the outstanding 41% of logistics companies have access to EDI like functionality and we will make it easy to implement with existing internal processes once full functionality is achieved.  

2. **Current progress:** Mockups are available on the company website, and development of that front end has already begun. Planning of the backend aspect has begun as well, BUT if we make the move to Kadena that will, of course, change. 

3. **Engagement:** We have already begun building a community around the project, and launch will be directed at existing small to medium sized logsitics companies in the Nashville TN area. 

4. **Future plans:** We will continue to add additional features to the platform as the industry evolves. 

5. **Other:** We are a small project with a big idea. Route ALL EDI transactions through the dEDI platform instead of the antiquated EDI system. Our target market is on average $26b annually with an estimated 20b transactions per year. This DOES NOT ACCOUNT for the 41% of logistics companies that do not use EDI as a result of the barriers to entry which we have mentioned above. Our target user base, initially, will be that 41%. Once we have established a strong userbase we will begin developing partnerships with existing EDI providers so that they may route their traffic through dEDI instead of through EDI. This will allow us to on-board large chunks of EDI traffic instead of adding one company at a time.
