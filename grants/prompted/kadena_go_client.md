## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### Title

[Go-Kadena](https://github.com/jfamousket/go-kadena): A Go client library for interacting with a Kadena chainweb node

### Motivation

- I think [Go](https://golang.org/) being a very popular language by google needs a client library to enable developers easily create applications to interact with the Kadena blockchain.

- Almost all solid layer 1 blockchain networks have a go client library and I would love to implement and maintain one for Kadena.

### Why Kadena

- I love the vision of Kadena bringing efficiency to blockchain with it's scalable PoW algorithm and I am sure it's the future of blockchain transactions.

- I am also an investor in the Kadena blockchain and would love to see it grow and scale as the world transitions to web3

## 4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1. **Market fit:**

- It adds a Go client library similar to [binance-chain-sdk](https://github.com/binance-chain/javascript-sdk) which would enable developer create applications to interact with the Kadena blockchain in Go.

2. **Current progress:**

- Currently a simple working version exists [here](https://github.com/jfamousket/go-kadena). This was just a simple template or start to show how the project would be created and has a few dependencies as seen [here](https://github.com/jfamousket/go-kadena/blob/master/go.mod).

3. **Engagement:**

- Initially the features stated on the project plan would be accomplished by me, the project would then become open to the community to contribute extra features and bug fixes as I think it would be impossible to get a complete version which satisfies all developer needs at first try.

- If given the grant I hope to make the library the official Go client for the Kadena blockchain which would be put in Kadena documentation and possibly hosted or mirrored on the official repositories.

4. **Future plans:**

- As said earlier after the project is completed, I plan for it to go into maintenance and further development stage where I would maintain and add features to it with the help of the Kadena community.
