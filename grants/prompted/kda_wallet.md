# KDA WALLET

## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The basic idea is to provide a KDA Wallet which could be downloaded and installed on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux machines.

With this tool users will be able to store their coins in a fancy way and also interact with dApps.

We know that you are working hard on Kadenaswap! The idea for the wallet came from our excitement from hearing the prospects of what will come from Kadena and the new DEX.

>Planned Features for V1.0
>- Show total balance - only show chain balances in specific screen
>- Transfer where user can choose any -> any, chainId -> chainId, any -> chainId 
>- Support all token types (as specified by user)
>- 2-way connection with dapps (secure sessions)

## 4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1. **Market fit:** With this tool we can develop, distribute and maintain only one project which will be cross platform and agnostic to the OS. In addition will be user friendly and will give the possibility to even less experienced users to interact with the KDA ecosystem.
2. **Current progress:** Currently we are committed on the architectural side of the project. The next step is to prepare mockups starting from the main features. 
3. **Future plans:** Once the project is completed, the plan is to maintain and develop other features based on the market requirements.
