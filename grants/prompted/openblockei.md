## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

>Please provide the following:
>- Title and brief description of the project
>- Motivation behind the project (objective / anticipated impact)
>- Why you chose to build on Kadena

### PROJECT TITLE - OPEN BLOCK ENTERPRISE INITIATIVE (OPEN BLOCK EI) ON KADENA

### MOTIVATION
The purpose of this project is to create an implementation of the Open Block Enterprise Inititaive (Open Block EI) on the Kadena blockchain. With Web 3 moving into the mainstream, the definition of Enterprise 
has yet to be established. In short the Web 3 community has yet to build infrastructure that enables innovators to scale readily to Enterprise level. This is a major hidden impediment to wider 
adoption. The Open Block Enterpise Initiative has been created to drive a community centric view of what Enterprise should be as communities strive to move away from the darker
and environmentally unfriendly corporate practice of the 20th Century. 

The objective of this project is to further an Open Source Commons of Web 3 Enterprise projects on Kadena that provide deliverables that can be readily integrated into new and existing dApp projects.
The anticipated impact of this is that dApps on Kadena would be able to better serve new communities without impacting their existing communities or re-learning lessons learnt by other ecosystem contributors or consuming projects.
### WHY KADENA
Web 3 Enterprise projects typically require a high number of internally triggered transactions which can mean actions such as role management can get expensive quickly even at highly optimised operational levels. 
As an implementation platform Kadena has been selected due to its unique features such as no gas transactions and energy efficiency.

|Technical Suppport (Kadena provided) | x 1  |

The delivery model for this project is to recruit and train a team that whilst not necessarily new to IT or blockchain would be new to the Kadena Ecosystem and the Pact smart contract language. 

**Project Lead** - Tau Ushe. <br/>
Mr Ushe has been in the blockchain space since 2011 and has recently worked on delivering Open Block EI for the NEAR Blockchain. He has won several hackathon 
prizes at events such as Eth Global, Babylon Hack, Ethcc, Learn NEAR Club and Encode Club.
