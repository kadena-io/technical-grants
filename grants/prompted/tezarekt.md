## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

> Tezarekt is a gamified NFT Marketplace and also a community-based platform that breaks the boundaries of traditional NFT collection by incorporating the arcade, puzzle and gachapon narrative. 
The core element of Tezarekt is the Gachapon System, originally vending machines that dispense random toys in capsules, where the buyer only finds out what they have received upon purchase. This adds a level of excitement for the buyer, as every series contains products categorized by their rarity levels - common to ultra-rare, and they may potentially obtain an item that is worth much more than what they paid for.
In one of our Gachapon modes we also have the Puzzle mode where collectors may purchase randomized fragments of NFTs which can be combined and exchanged for a completed piece. These fragmented pieces contain visual and/or audible elements that are unique to the completed NFT of that particular series. 
The unused puzzle pieces among the collection can be broken down into “Frags” which can then be traded for our proprietary in-house NFTs, each having randomized unique traits, similar to Cryptopunks or the Bored Apes from the Bored Ape Yacht Club. However, our in-house NFTs come with extra utilities, such as airdrops. Each series of the in-house NFTs will be fixed at 10,000 pieces. (in the near future)

> Tezarekt is founded by a team of five friends who have known each other for more than a decade. Brought together by their love of beatboxing (vocal percussion), they attended the Beatbox Battle World Championships 2012 in Berlin, and experienced the strength and unity of the world-wide beatboxing community. Back then, the event was facing a lack of funding.
Fast-forward to 2021, the world-wide beatboxing community has grown in strength but the international battle events still depended on sponsorships. The team knew that they were uniquely positioned to tackle the issue, and they decided to create Tezarekt to empower and enable not just the beatboxing community, but others such as the dance communities and aspiring artist communities to become truly self-sustaining ecosystems through the use of their Gachapon System.
Swissbeatbox, the organizers of the world’s largest beatbox events is officially partnering with Tezarekt to release the first ever Grand Beatbox Battle 2021 AllStar NFT Here are some of their social media statistics:  
>>Youtube: 4.28m Followers  
TikTok: 2.4m Followers  
Douyin: 840k Followers  
Instagram: 551k Followers

> We are confident that sales of the GBB21 AllStar NFT Collectibles to this untapped market will benefit both Tezarekt and the beatboxing community immensely, allowing for the beatboxing ecosystem to become self-sustainable, without the need to rely on outside sponsorships.
Why Kadena?
After doing much research, we have decided that Kadena would be the perfect blockchain for us to build on, due to the elimination of gas fees, as we want to keep our NFTs affordable for our initial buyers, who may not be crypto-savvy.

>**Frags**  
Frags are our in-house currency that have specific usage on our platform. They can be obtained in two ways, either by breaking down unused NFTs (extra puzzle pieces or duplicate NFTs) or through staking rewards. Each Frag is worth $1 USDT.  For example, a watch bezel piece worth $40 USDT can be broken down into 40 Frags. Frags can be used for 2 things: to purchase In-House NFTs and for governance votes in future.  

>**Refrekt System**  
Once a gacha series or machine has been cleared, we will make an announcement that the machine is wrecked (“rekt”). We will then generate 3 random numbers representing buyers of the Gachapon series as well as In-House NFT holders and reward the users with matching numbers. A series with a revenue of 800k USD will have a prize pool of 20k USD. The top 3 players will get 20%, 10% & 5% of the prize pool respectively, while the remainder will be distributed evenly among the rest of the in-house NFT holders as long as they are still on our platform.

>**Leaderboard**  
We will be implementing different categories of a leaderboard system on our platform, For example, being ranked by the total volume of NFTs collected or traded, or being the Top Fragger of the month etc.  
Users will be able to leave their name on the blockchain ledger based on their achievements.  
Top ranking players will be rewarded accordingly with prizes and occasionally some of our TEZA tokens.  

>**Staking**  
Players can stake their $TEZA in the liquidity pool and earn passive revenue coming from the platform’s gachapon revenue and the staking reserve. Staking unlocks the Teza Round Table which rewards the player in the form of tokens, special excess, exclusive NFTs & Frags. The Staking Reserve will be initialized with 20% of the total amount of $TEZA minted. And scheduled for release over 10 years for staking rewards.

>**Voting & Governance**  
Players are able to use Frags as votes on elements like prioritization of feature development and the asset curation process. We will be implementing more features that can be voted on as the platform grows. Each frag can only be used for one vote. Once used, the Frags will be removed.

## 4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1. **Market fit:**
>Tezarekt addresses the funding problems facing niche communities such as the beatboxing community (and eventually others such as the dance community), who depend heavily on sponsorships to keep the ecosystem running. The key advantage we have is our strong presence, key leadership position, influence and trust we have within the international beatboxing community.
2. **Current progress:**
>Minimum Viable Product is completed, that is: Website UI/UX all three gachapon modes, user profile page and marketplace.
3. **Engagement:**
>We will primarily utilize our social media reach, with Dharni having 6.7 million followers across his various social media platforms, and Swissbeatbox, our official partners for our Grand Beatbox Battle 2021 AllStar NFT having 7 million followers across their various social media platforms
4. **Future plans:**
>The long-term future plans of Tezarekt include the creation of the Tezarekt Game World, an MMORPG-type game that incorporates the NFT items bought from our Gachapon Machines by imbuing them with skill points and abilities. We are also looking at utilizing AR Technology to link Physical items with the Virtual world.
